            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE I was last with you I have thought of what you said, <hi>That ere long all Our Parish Churches would be in your Possession:</hi> This hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned me to Write (I will not say my Advice) but my Opinion. That you and your Clergy should not Attempt that which I perceive you have already in your Speculations: They who know the History of your Services in the last Wars, and since, must acknowledge that you have deserved well of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:201986:2"/>your Prince, in that not onely you asserted his Cause in the Field with the loss of a Limb, but which is more, you Discovered to one of his great Ministers of State the Design of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, managed by Sir <hi>K. D.</hi> and Father <hi>H.</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Sorbonist, to put their part of this Nation under the Subjection and Patronage of <hi>Oliver.</hi> It is in respect to you, and so many as are of your Loyalty as well as Religion, that I wish in the Game they now play, by ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring high, they may not lose all. You are much mistaken, if from a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you conclude an assurance of Publick Establishment. It is one thing to gain a favourable look, another, that one should so fall in love, as to Espouse your Cause. Consider the Difficulties, if not Impossibilities, which in great Number oppose your Hopes. The Chiefest, as you ought to apprehend, is the firm Resolution of the King to Defend the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it yet stands; a Resolution in him so immovable, that neither an Interest in Mighty Princes, obtainable by such an Exchange, could Invite, nor the Arguments of Military Men could Perswade him to renounce that Church, from which he then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no Advantage, but the satisfaction of her Communion, and suffering in her Defence. You cannot but know withal that to believe Him inclinable to you, is to Commit Treason in your Hearts, since that to say so, is declared Treason by an Act of Parliament. But if you should prove so Sanguine and full of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as to believe what was formerly ineffectual, might now prevail: I cannot commend your Judgment, except you shew that either your Religion is better, or else that Interest doth more strongly draw the King towards you now than heretofore. For the former part, Religion, you say it ought not in the least to be altered; and we acknowledge if it were Reformed it will be less worth to the Clergy. For the other, concerning Interest of State, if it disswade under those Circumstances, much more will it at this Day. In those Times he might by this course have been Restored to three Kingdoms. Now he would hereby give up half his Jurisdiction, to wit, Supremacy; and after a while, a good part of his Revenue, the appendant Possessions of his Supremacy: But this is not the worst; for besides this by setting up Popery, he sets up the Pope as his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue and fellow Soveraign in all His Majesty's Dominions. He gives him at once all the Clergy, and implicitely as many as they frighten with Purgatory and Hell — To Obey Gods Vicar rather than Man: This hath been done, not in the case of the Church alone, but in Temporal Quarrels betwixt him and other Princes. But if you still hold the conclusion against unanswerable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, what means pray can you propose whereby this may be accomplished? Exercise all your Imaginative Power, Fancy any thing, though never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be granted or practised, so it be but in the utmost degree of Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There are but two ways to do it, either by Parliament, and you cannot expect that this Parliament, which appeared so earnest against your Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, should set you up as the National Church. And if you hope this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may quickly Dye of Old Age, and that another more favourable to the Distressed, may sit in their rooms, you will find your self mistaken; and that it is not your Party shall be the Men, but rather such, who though they served your turn, never Loved you when they were uppermost.</p>
            <p>Let me farther advise you not to forfeit your discretion so far, as to expect as sudden a publick Change of Religion now by a Parliament, as was in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes; Then the Reformation had onely been begun by King <hi>Edward</hi> his six years Reign, and Carelesly Managed by the Greatest Persons under Him, whose Chiefest aimes appear to be quite another thing: So that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:201986:2"/>whilst they Neglected to bring over the Countrey Gentlemen to Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, they confirmed them in Popery. Thence was it that the Romanists might much better promise themselves to be restored under that Queen, then at these years when people still remember her; and for several Generations have been reconciled to the Reformation by Writings in those Controversies, and held in by penal Lawes—, and estranged from <hi>Rome</hi> by 88. and the 5th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> Now you cannot look for any Good from a Parliament, you may rightly Dread their displeasure; especially if you should stretch your Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to the perverting of other Mens: For do what you can, and Declaim never so much against a Parliamentary Religion; The Commons will have a Committee for Religion, or else Liberty and Priviledge are utterly lost. So that you ought by a private exercise of your Worship, and a peaceable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour to provide for the coming of a Parliament, as by Repentance men do for Death, because it cannot be avoided, but may be made less hurtful—. By this time, I suppose, you may have laid aside all hopes of being Advanced by a Parliament, and cast your Thoughts towards a standing Army; Certainly you will find this conceit as Aiery as any of the rest, for (besides that he whose Authority should raise it, intends you no more then a bare and limited Toleration) there are very many and Obvious Hinderances of that project, The Kingdom being an Island, takes away the pretences hereof, which are alleadged by our powerful Neighbours, and allowed by reason of their Scituation. So that on the surmizes of such a thing, the Mutinous Temper of this Climate would appear as Jealous of their Liberties, as in some Countreys men are of their Wives. And withall, where could you raise Men for the Service? your own Gentlemen of Estates would not endure Forreigners; and they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily want home-born Souldiers, their being not a sufficient Number of your Religion, and of none to give the law of Armes to all your Adversaries. And where will you get the main Weapon, Money? Though your Religion should open their stock and Treasure as for a Holy War, yet in a little Time either their stock or their Zeal would be spent, and then an Army in its own Country cannot so easily get Bread by the sword, as Labouring men can do by the spade. For proof of this, you may call to mind how that both Rump and Army were well nigh famished into a <hi>Dissolution,</hi> when the Countrey declared they would pay no mores Taxes. In such Necessities Souldiers like Beasts of prey will fall one upon another and devour their Keepers too; And if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be wholly Mercenary, they are never so likely to be hired to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign contrary to their former Commission, as when their Masters cannot pay, nor their Enemies can be plundered, yet will freely part with mony upon their own termes. You see, Sir, how I have followed your Propagators through all, both Probable and Wild Methods, which they can invent; all which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unprofitable and Unlikely, they will not surely like vain Projectors, waste what they have, for that which they can never obtain—.</p>
